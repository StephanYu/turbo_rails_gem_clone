# TurboRailsGem

This is a simplified replica of the [hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) gem.
The main motivation for this project was to gain a deeper understanding of Turbo.
As described on the Turbo website [here](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction), it bundles several techniques for creating fast, modern, progressively enhanced web applications without the need for much JavaScript.
